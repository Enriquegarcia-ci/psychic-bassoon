# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

An autonomous robot built using a Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors that can detect and avoid obstacles in real-time. The robot also streams telemetry data to a connected PC using UDP.

## Features
- Real-time obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensor
- Motor control using Python and GPIO
- Wireless data communication to PC
- Expandable architecture for future features

## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 400W Brushless with Hall 6-60V DC Motor Drive 
- Hoverboard motors
- Ryobe Batteries
- Chassis

## How It Works
The robot continuously measures distance in front of it. When an object is detected within 20cm, it stops and changes direction. Sensor data is streamed to a local PC for monitoring.


## Hi
this is a work in progress and most things will be missing.
